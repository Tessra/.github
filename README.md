# Tessra

**Tessra** is a **modular feature-focused boilerplate** designed to speed up app development by encapsulating features into independent, reusable modules. It includes common elements like dashboards, CRUD operations, authentication, and landing pages, with each feature stored in its own folder. The project is structured to simplify the integration of new modules, making it easy to build scalable and dynamic web applications.

The modular system is powered by metadata within each feature folder, enabling automatic registration and management of components. Tessra aims to provide developers with the flexibility to extend and adapt the app architecture with minimal configuration, laying the foundation for a **templating wizard** in the future.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Each feature (Dashboard, CRUD, Auth, etc.) is encapsulated in its own folder with associated metadata, making integration seamless.
- **Rapid Development**: Build applications faster with pre-built components that can be customized and combined as needed.
- **Metadata-Driven**: Feature information and registration are managed through metadata, allowing automatic handling of module integration.
- **Scalable**: Designed with extensibility in mind, Tessra allows you to add new modules as your application grows.
- **Future-Proof**: Planning to expand into a **templating wizard** to further simplify app creation.
